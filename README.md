# Love Your Heart: Interactive Heart Risk Predictor with Machine Learning
** This is work in progress **

**Project Description**: We aim to build an interactive web app that predicts an individual’s risk of heart disease based on self-reported lifestyle and health factors (such as age, BMI, smoking, and physical activity). Users can enter their information in a Streamlit interface and receive an ML-generated risk score together with personalized feedback from a chatbot on how to reduce their risk through lifestyle changes.
Optionally, the model will include explainable machine learning components (e.g., feature importance visualization) to highlight which modifiable factors contribute most to the prediction.

**Data sub-fields**: Health, Wellbeing

**Tools (software, Python libraries…)**: Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, (keras/tesorflow)), Streamlit, generative AI

**Data Source (link to web, self collecting...?)**
